a) The runtime complexity is O(n). This is because a is equal to n * n, and the while loop only runs on a single additional * n




b)	b) The runtime complexity is O(n^2). This is because we enter a loop inside of a loop that are both n based. So we will have to run over n * n




c)	c) The runtime complexity is O(n). This is because each time the function will return 1 less than it was before, so we will only run as many times as we were initially given
