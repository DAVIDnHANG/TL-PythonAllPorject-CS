a) Runtime complexity is O(n) because n is increasing linearly with a single step.




b)	b) Runtime complexity is O(n) because even though there is a second loop, the second loop is not re-iterating over n, it is only using it as a comparison.




c)	c) Runtime complexity is O(1) because you are returning a constant value and not looping over anything even if you are recursing a single time.

Since we already know that the floors are a pre-sorted list, binary search would be the fastest because it will return in constant time.
